quick sorting
============
我沒有使用遞迴來寫quick sorting，我的作法是用一開始的array來進行quick sorting 的所有步驟，標記已經選過的數字，
再用另一個一樣長的array來記已經選過的數字，以免它們被重複選到。
就結果而言，就多出了相當多的步驟......
>def quick_sort(original_array):
我把要用來排序的array稱為original_array

>recording_array=np.copy(original_array)
recording_array專門用來記錄選過了哪些數字，對應'被選過數字的最終位置'的那一格會是-1，這個array長度固定


> operation_array=np.copy(original_array)
這是代表'當前進行排列'的子序列，長度會改變，最大當然就是一開始的長度

Use 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex. "it's all in
chapters 12--14"). Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis.



An h2 header
------------

Here's a numbered list:

 1. first item
 2. second item
 3. third item

Note again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters
from the left side). Here's a code sample:

    # Let me re-iterate ...
    for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }

As you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead of
indenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, if you like:

~~~
define foobar() {
    print "Welcome to flavor country!";
}
~~~

(which makes copying & pasting easier). You can optionally mark the
delimited block for Pandoc to syntax highlight it:

~~~python
import time
# Quick, count to ten!
for i in range(10):
    # (but not *too* quick)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    print i
~~~



### An h3 header ###

Now a nested list:

 1. First, get these ingredients:

      * carrots
      * celery
      * lentils

 2. Boil some water.

 3. Dump everything in the pot and follow
    this algorithm:

        find wooden spoon
        uncover pot
        stir
        cover pot
        balance wooden spoon precariously on pot handle
        wait 10 minutes
        goto first step (or shut off burner when done)

    Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall.

Notice again how text always lines up on 4-space indents (including
that last line which continues item 3 above). Here's a link to [a
website](http://foo.bar). Here's a link to a [local
doc](local-doc.html). Here's a footnote [^1].

Tables can look like this:

size  material      color
----  ------------  ------------
9     leather       brown
10    hemp canvas   natural
11    glass         transparent

Table: Shoes, their sizes, and what they're made of

(The above is the caption for the table.) Here's a definition list:

apples
  : Good for making applesauce.
oranges
  : Citrus!
tomatoes
  : There's no "e" in tomatoe.

Again, text is indented 4 spaces. (Alternately, put blank lines in
between each of the above definition list lines to spread things
out more.)

Inline math equations go in like so: $\omega = d\phi / dt$. Display
math should get its own line and be put in in double-dollarsigns:

$$I = \int \rho R^{2} dV$$

Done.
